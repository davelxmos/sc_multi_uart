Multi Uart Demo
===============

:scope: Example
:description: An example application that demonstrates the multi-uart component
:keywords: uart, slicekit

This demo application shows the working of the multi-uart software
component. The application acts as a loopback between the uart rx
ports and the uart tx, mirroring everything that comes in on a receive
port to a corresponding transmit port. It runs on the a
slicekit core board with a multi-uart slice attached.

Details of this application can be found in the multi-uart design guide.
